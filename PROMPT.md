# Implementation Prompt: Notification Rules Engine

## Context

You are implementing a REST API project from a PRD. The SpecLeft MCP is installed and available. Use it to drive the full workflow: generate a behavioural spec, produce tests from that spec, implement the code to pass those tests, and raise a pull request.

Do not ask clarifying questions. All requirements are defined in the PRD. Make reasonable engineering decisions where the PRD is silent.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 environment available
- Git repository initialised with a `main` branch
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) available and authenticated
- Use SpecLeft MCP if the MCP config is setup in the project, otherwise follow your most suitable implementation workflow for this project that is not SpecLeft.
- If SpecLeft MCP is there - you must follow it's resources and CLI workflow pattern. It is not complex.

---

## Resources

**Product Requirements Doc**: PRD.md

**Skill**: SKILL.md

---

## Instructions

1. Derive a behavioural spec from the PRD
2. Produce tests from the spec before writing any implementation
3. Implement the API to pass all tests
4. Ensure all tests pass locally before proceeding
5. Commit the implementation to a new branch named `feat/notification-rules-engine`
6. Raise a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what was built and why

Do not modify the tests to make them pass. Fix the implementation instead.

### Retrospective

 1. Run server and verify behaviour in ../prd.
 2. Confirm all behaviour from prd are covered (if using specleft mcp, run: `specleft status`)
 2. Once behaviour is confirmed as working - briefly summarise retrospectively on how the implementation went for this project:
- How many failed test runs before all tests pass
- Time spent on phases: spec externalisation, implementation, testing, behaviour verification
- Clarity of project scope on each phase (letter grade scoring): spec externalisation, implementation, testing, behaviour verification
- What went well
- what was missed or inefficient
- what to improve and what can be done to help achieve improvements
3. Publish this retro in to the comments of the created PR
